# OSM Hackfest 2022, Nepal

## About

We are an Open Tech Community working together to bring an inspiring community across the country to form a better future with Open Technologies and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Our community is a team of volunteers dedicated to build capacity and raise awareness amongst various institutes in Nepal including government bodies and universities.

Open Tech is a set of technologies which are built over the philosophy of openness and freedom. Currently, our team is formed with a group of professionals working in the area of Open Data, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Open Mapping.

Currently, we are running a series of events across colleges in Nepal to share the knowledge of Open Technologies and grow the network of contributors.


### Open Technologies

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)**

OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable geographic database of the world. The geodata underlying the maps is considered the primary output of the project. The data on OpenStreetMap is freely available under the open database licence which allows a number of tools and services to be built on top of it. Currently there are more than 8 million registered users worldwide contributing to OpenStreetMap.

**Open Data**

Open Data is data that anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness). Open data is licensed under an open licence. Governments, businesses and individuals can use open data to bring about social, economic and environmental benefits.

**Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)**

FOSS is software that is both free software and open-source software where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users.


### Who are we?

**Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific**

The Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific is a space for everyone interested in contributing to the OpenStreetMap movement in the region. The hub aims to power the evolution and growth of OpenStreetMap ecosystems in 25 priority countries across Asia Pacific. The Open Mapping Hub is currently supporting the OSM community through grant funding, training, and regional knowledge sharing with a focus on 6 countries - Bangladesh, Fiji, Indonesia, Kiribati, Nepal and the Philippines.

**FOSS Community**

FOSS community is a team of volunteers dedicated to raise awareness among general public, government bodies, private sector, civil society, educational institutions and media for expanding the scope of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) via Free and Open Source Software.

**Kathmandu Living Labs**

KLL is a leading civic-tech company based out of Nepal. Founded in 2013, primarily, to advance the Open Mapping movement, KLL has trained and engaged thousands of people from Nepal and other Asian countries in mapping their local communities in OpenStreetMap (OSM). As a social enterprise, KLL provides data and technology solutions to governments, development partners, businesses and civil society. In recognition of KLL’s works, it has received several national and international awards.

**Open Knowledge Nepal**

Open Knowledge Nepal is a non-profit civic tech organisation composed of openness aficionados. OKN believes that the openness of data is powerful in order to have a participatory government with civil society, eventually leading to sustainable development. OKN has been involved in research, advocacy, training, workshops and developing tools related to open knowledge.
